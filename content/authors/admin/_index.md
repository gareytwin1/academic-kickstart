I'm an aspiring data scientist and graduate student at Texas A&M University, where I'm pursuing a Master of Engineering degree. I'm passionate about leadership, and I love anything that has to do with coding. For the last ten years, I worked operations for Exxon Mobil as a plant operator, console supervisor, and shift team leader but parted ways earlier this year to follow my passion for programming and data science. My interest includes data science, machine learning, software development, financial engineering, and cloud computing. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, going on trips, spending time with family, and discussing stock option strategies.
